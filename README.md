# Zeroshot Text-to-ImageAI

**Course:** CS550 Machine Learning, IIT Bhilai  
**Group Name:** Zeroshot Dreamers  
**Project Title:** Zero-shot Text-to-Image Generator

## Project Overview

Text-to-ImageAI is a deep learning-based project focused on generating images from textual descriptions in a zero-shot learning setting. This project aims to develop a generative model that can understand and interpret natural language to create high-quality images without requiring pre-labeled datasets.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a zero-shot text-to-image model that leverages the latest advancements in natural language processing and generative modeling to generate realistic images based on input text.

## Key Features

- Zero-shot learning for image generation
- Integration of state-of-the-art models like CLIP and GANs
- Realistic, high-resolution image generation
- Multilingual support for text inputs

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Text-to-ImageAI.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Text-to-ImageAI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To generate an image from text:

```bash
python generate.py --text "A dog running in the park"
```

## Results

The generated images will be saved in the `output` folder. Examples of generated images from sample texts can be found in the `examples` folder.
